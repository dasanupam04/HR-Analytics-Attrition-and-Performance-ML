📊 HR Analytics & Employee Intelligence


An end-to-end Machine Learning project that analyzes employee data to generate business insights and predictive models for salary estimation, attrition risk, and department classification.

This project demonstrates how HR data can be transformed into actionable intelligence using regression, classification, and ensemble learning techniques.


🚀 Project Overview

This repository builds multiple predictive models using employee data to help HR teams:

Predict Monthly Income (Regression)

Predict Employee Attrition Risk (Classification)

Classify Employee Department (Multi-class Classification)

All models are trained using real-world HR-style features such as job level, experience, satisfaction scores, and compensation data.
